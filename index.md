### Forecasting Stock Market Closing Values Using LSTM

<p align="center">

This project involved developing a machine learning application to forecast the closing values of custom stock market tickers. This task is important for financial planning and investment decisions. I used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which is effective for time series prediction tasks due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies. I also implemented methods to handle missing data and distribution shifts in time series and optimized the model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

### Cross-Domain Hate Speech Detection using Large Language Models

As hate speech has become a serious issue on social media platforms, it's important to have effective tools for detecting such content. The aim of this project was to detect hate speech in tweets and evaluate the detection capabilities on different platforms like Wikipedia and Reddit. We used the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a popular choice for NLP tasks due to its effectiveness in understanding the context of words in a sentence.
