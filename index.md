### Cross-Domain Hate Speech Detection using Large Language Models

This project involved creating a machine learning model to detect hate speech in text. We used the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a popular choice for NLP tasks due to its effectiveness in understanding the context of words in a sentence.

#### Problem Statement

The aim of this project was to detect hate speech in tweets and evaluate the detection capabilities on different platforms like Wikipedia and Reddit. As hate speech has become a serious issue on social media platforms, it's important to have effective tools for detecting such content.
